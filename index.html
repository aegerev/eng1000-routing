      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        For over a year, I have been trying to help people like you master (or learn) the English language.
        <br/>
        That’s the mission of the ENG-1000 program in its simplest form.
      </p>

      <p>
       Our mission is educational - to teach you the English language and how to use the English language in your everyday life.  
        <br/>
        We do that through the prism of events/topics that can range between artificial intelligence and global warming, just to name a few. 
      </p>

      <p>
        My goal as a tutor is to give you the knowledge and the tools that will empower you to be a better wielder of the English language and to be a better person. I’m here to make sure you don’t give up, because I think there’s always something that’s working and this program is all about helping you identify new words, new grammar rules, and help you use those new words and new grammar rules in your everyday life.
      </p>
      
      <p>That’s the mission. All of this is in the name of education. Together, we will be working on building the foundation for you to succeed in learning or advancing your English, which will help you succeed in life! I am invested in your success, and I am here to help you.</p>
        <br/>
        So, if you're ready to take your English to the next level, please consider <a href="https://preply.com/en/tutor/4048617">booking a trial class with me!</a> 

      <p>I hope to see you soon!</p>
